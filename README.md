# ERC-20 token + Bucket Challenge

[Alchemy University](https://university.alchemy.com)'s Ethereum Developer Bootcamp Week6 tasks:

- ERC-20 token deployed on GÃ¶rli: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xe6f3636da100a2a1d523edd7aa0fa8cac77a913b1e9bb30af67d95f40be89c51

- `approve_transfer.js` is the solution of the "Bucket Challenge", so the contract addresses of the deployed contract and the Bucket contract are hardcoded in the file

    Usage (in project root):

        $ npx hardhat run scripts/approve_transfer.js

    Winner transaction: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xe6f3636da100a2a1d523edd7aa0fa8cac77a913b1e9bb30af67d95f40be89c51
